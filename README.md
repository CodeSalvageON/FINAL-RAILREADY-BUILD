The current build of RailReady2, a parody game based off of the horrendous education program known as i-Ready. So far, this build only has the data for RailReady1 and the i-Ready Recreation Center, but many planned features are working quite fine. Unfortunately the game does not run very well on computers with smaller monitors, but this can always be fixed by setting the web view to 80% or lower if needed. Flickering should not be a huge issue unless you are using an older 32bit computer.
